# personal-portfolio-template

A customizable portfolio website template

Hello! To properly fork this project from GitHub, click the green code button and copy the link provided under HTTPS

Once that link is copied, open up VSCode and on the top middle of your screen, there should be a search bar, where you should type ">". This should give a "Git: Clone" prompt that you should press. Afterwards, you should paste the link you copied and hit enter. You will then have to select a location for where you want the personal project template to be stored on your computer.

Once there is a designated location on your computer, you can now open the project. Make sure you open it in VSCode to the folder, "template", not "personal-portfolio-template"

Next, you are going to run npm install so that your local machine can download the proper dependencies

Once the dependencies have been installed, you can now run "npm run dev" to get a local server running. A link towards that server will pop up in the terminal, and once you click on that link, you are all set for your own personal project!
